# number of validation error messages to show for

# Poolsize; number of worker processes to run concurrently
PoolSize = 3
# notes:
# 
# best initial sizing is number of cores on machine -1; each core gets a 
# processor chain, with one left for database processes.
# 
# only run large poolsizes (> 30 workers) on mac/linux, tcp will throttle on
# windows. 
# also note above poolsize 50 on mac increase ulimits from default (256) e.g.
# $ ulimit -n 2048
# otherwise tcp will run out of aviailable file handles
